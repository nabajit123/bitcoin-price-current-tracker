SELECT * FROM `table name` WHERE 1 # The SQL query you provided is a basic SELECT statement that 
                                    # retrieves all columns (*) from a table named "table name" where 
                                    # the condition WHERE 1 is always true. Using WHERE 1 is essentially a way 
                                    # of selecting all rows from the table without applying any specific conditions, as 
                                    # the condition 1 is always true.
